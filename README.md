Football Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning
# ⚽ Football Match Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the outcome of football matches (Win / Draw / Loss) using historical match data from Kaggle. The notebook trains and evaluates a machine learning model to analyze team performance metrics and predict match results.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Football is a dynamic sport where accurate match predictions can help fans, analysts, and fantasy league players make data-driven decisions.
This notebook applies **machine learning algorithms** to predict the result of a football match based on key match statistics.

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle (Football Match Dataset)
* **Data Includes:**

  * Team names
  * Goals scored and conceded
  * Match location
  * Possession, shots, fouls, and other performance metrics
* The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and used for training and testing.

---

## 🧮 Model & Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Handling missing values
   * Encoding categorical variables (e.g., team names, match results)
   * Normalizing numerical features

2. **Model Training:**

   * Applied machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **XGBoost** (based on your notebook implementation).
   * Split dataset into training and testing subsets.
   * Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

3. **Prediction:**

   * The final trained model predicts whether a team will **Win**, **Draw**, or **Lose** a match.
